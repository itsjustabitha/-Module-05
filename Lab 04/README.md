Exercise 4 Slide: 43

Instructions: 
Use the Express App template in Exercise4/m5lab4_expressapp from Google Drive. The friendRoutes.js file details 4
tasks to give more understanding on setting up different types of requests via routes:
Exercise 4

Part 1: Add support to the 'filter' endpoint for a new query parameter 'letter' which filters friends by starting
letter

Part 2: Modify the 'info' route to only return the user-agent, content-type and accept header data

Part 3: Modify the dynamic GET route to return a single friend object matching the dynamic 'id' request
parameter

Part 4: Complete the PUT route which will update data for an existing friend

Test each of the above with different values, and include some basic data validation.
